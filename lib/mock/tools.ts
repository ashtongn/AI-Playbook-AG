// ── Approved tools roster — Tool Card 2.0 (Sprint 2, launcher-first) ─────────
// EXECUTIVE DECISION (1 Jul 2026): commercial tools are out. Everything listed
// here is approved for official use (confirm locally). If it is on this page, it
// is an approved tool. Personal-use commercial tools are deliberately not listed.
//
// Design principle (19 Jul design review): a play card is a lesson; a tool card
// is a door. Every live tool has one launch_url (the official door), a checkable
// access path for first-timers, an honest verified-as-of date, and one first move.
//
// Plain-language rule: no Impact Level or compliance jargon in any Airman-facing
// string. Say what it means instead. Terminology per project lexicon (C1–C6).
